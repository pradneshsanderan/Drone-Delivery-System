# Drone Delivery System
## About
In this project, I devised and implemented an algorithm to model a drone's flight path, making deliveries from synthetic test data to check if a
drone delivery system would be feasible and if the drone could complete all orders for the day before running out of battery. To do this, I optimised the greedy heuristic, Dijkstra's algorithm and christofides algorithm to get the best flight path that completed the delivery
for 99% of the test data.
